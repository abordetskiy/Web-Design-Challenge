# Welcome to the WeatherPy Dashboard!

As the website provdes all of the analysis and use instructions, this readme should remain fairly short. The link to the GitHub Page is:

https://abordetskiy.github.io/Web-Design-Challenge/index.html

All the HTML files used have been copied from the main folder to the docs folder to be deployed correctly with GitHub Pages. This would need to be redone if the WeatherPy.ipyng analysis was re-ran AND the page was accessed via GitHub Pages. The index.html file outside of the docs folder will update automatically with output from WeatherPy.ipynb and can be run locally with a browser.

The WeatherPy.ipyng file includes an API Key for OpenWeatherAPI that is ignored by Git and supplied via a .env file. In order to run real-time data, please enter a valid api key, or import a CSV file. Directions for both options are in the WeatherPy.ipynb file comments.

I opted to use in-line styling as there was minimal additions needed to the bootstrap elements on this project.
